Java Collections - Beginner Exercises

This repository contains a series of basic exercises designed to help beginners understand and practice the use of collections in Java . It focuses on core structures such as ArrayList, HashSet, and ListIterator, offering hands-on experience working with both simple data types and custom objects.

Key Topics:

ArrayList manipulation : creation, insertion, ordering, and traversal with custom classes like Month.
HashSet usage : ensuring uniqueness, handling duplicates, and overriding equals() and hashCode() methods.
Iterators : using for loops and Iterator for reading collections, and ListIterator for advanced operations like reverse traversal.
Custom object modeling , such as the Restaurant class, to manage business logic within collections.
Learning Approach:

These exercises are structured to build a solid foundation in Java collections from scratch, helping learners understand how each structure behaves and how to use them effectively in real-world scenarios.

Perfect for students or self-taught developers looking to strengthen their knowledge before moving on to more advanced Java topics.
